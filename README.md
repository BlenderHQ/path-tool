# Path Tool
Multi purpose Blender 2.8x addon for selecting and marking up mesh object elements.
There is support for working simultaneously with multiple objects in edit mode.

# Installation
Installation is standard for Blender (Go to `Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install` and select the downloaded archive).

# Quick Guide
So, after installing the addon, you can get to work. To do this, select one or more meshes and go into edit mode. In the toolbar, select the Path Tool. Next, select the mesh elements that serve as control elements.
>Important: For convenience, for edges, vertices act as control elements, so if you start working with vertices, you will switch to working in edges
